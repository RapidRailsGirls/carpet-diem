# How to play
To start the game ...do something...

To move the carpet (that's you, the player) to the left, use the :arrow_left: key, to move carpet to the right, use the :arrow_right: key.
Bump into a lamp to see if a good or an evil genie pops out. Avoid the evil one! It steals points from your score! Catch the good ones to add points to your score.
The aim of the game: don't let the evil genies win!


# Acknowledgements
This game came about during our Rails Girls Summer of Code. We were inspired by [Rin Räuber's talk about Gosu](https://github.com/rin/eurucamp) at eurucamp 2014.
We'd like to thank Madgalena Frankiewicz, who had the initial spark for starting this game ("I like flying carpets. Lets build a game where you play a flying carpet"). A big thank you goes also out
to Klaus Fleerkötter, Steffi Tinder and Erik Michaels-Ober, who spent a lot of time helping us, giving hints, explaining patiently and thus adding to the fun we had building this game! :+1: :rose:
